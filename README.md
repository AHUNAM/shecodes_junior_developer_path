# SheCodes Junior Developer Path

Welcome to my SheCodes learning journey! This repository is a living record of my **first step into the coding world**, where I began building real-world projects and mastering front-end development through SheCodes workshops and challenges.

## 👩‍💻 About This Journey

This path began with curiosity and a deep desire to build solutions that matter — especially in the **health sector**. With a background in public health and a passion for innovation, I embarked on this coding journey to bridge the gap between healthcare and technology.

Through this repository, I’m working toward earning the **SheCodes Junior Developer Badge**, which showcases hands-on experience with:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Responsive design and mobile optimization
- APIs and integration
- Hosting and deployment tools
- Version control using Git and GitHub

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder represents nexted folders containing weekly or badge-specific challenges, containing source files, notes, and completed projects.

I'm currently on every lesson to gain mastery — not just completion — and create a strong foundation for future health-focused web solutions.

## 💡 Why This Matters to Me

I believe that **technology can make healthcare more accessible, personalized, and empowering**. This journey isn’t just about learning to code — it’s about learning to build digital tools that can support better health outcomes, especially in underrepresented communities.

## 🌱 What’s Next

After completing this path, I plan to:
- Build health-focused web apps for education, access, and wellness.
- Learn backend and database tools to create full-stack solutions.
- Explore AI and APIs for personalized health support.

## 🙌 A Note of Gratitude

Thanks to [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io) for creating such an empowering space for women in tech. This is just the beginning — and I’m excited for what’s ahead!
