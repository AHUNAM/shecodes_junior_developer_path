# HTML Elements Challenge

## 📝 Challenge Instructions
Recreate the demo found at: (https://codepen.io/matthieua/full/NZLByx?editors=1000)

This project was assigned as my first SheCodes Basics learning. The goal is to understand the foundational structure of HTML by replicating a live CodePen project.

---

## 💻 What I Built
A simple HTML page that includes:
- A level-one heading (`<h1>`) titled **SheCodes**
- An unordered list with three items: *Coders*, *Courses*, and *Stories*
- A horizontal rule (`<hr>`) to separate content
- Bold text using the `<strong>` tag labeled **More info**
- in summary I reproduced the layout and content structure of the provided CodePen link using only HTML

---

## 🌱 What I Learned
- The importance of semantic HTML elements for structure and accessibility
- Proper formatting of HTML files (indentation, nesting, and commenting)
- How to structure a basic HTML page from scratch
- The difference between block-level elements like `<h1>` and `<ul>` and inline elements
- The use of `<strong>` for semantic emphasis (accessibility-wise, not just visual bolding)
- The purpose of `<hr>` to visually divide content

## 💡 Health Tech Application
Understanding semantic structure and learning to structure information clearly with HTML is foundational for building accessible web tools for healthcare like:
- Symptom cards/checkers
- Patient/health info dashboards
- Medical forms
- appointment systems 

Clear structure means better usability for everyone, including screen readers and users with disabilities.

This knowledge sets the stage for accessible, well-structured health communication interfaces.
