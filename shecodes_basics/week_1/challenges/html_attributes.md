# HTML Attributes Challenge
This challenge focuses on using **HTML attributes** to activate texts into pages in a basic web page. Atributes add more functionality and meaning to basic HTML elements, modify how they behave or even help channel displayed content.

## Overview of Code
- Used the ankle link `<a>` to link three different SheCodes pages using `href`:
  - Coders â†’ https://www.shecodes.io/students
  - Courses â†’ https://www.shecodes.io/workshops
  - Stories â†’ https://www.shecodes.io/stories
- Added the `target="_blank"` attribute so the links so they open in a new tab.
- Added a horizontal line `<br />` to start image on a new line
- Included an image using the `<img>` tag with:
  - `src` (link to the image)
  - `alt` (alternative text for accessibility)
  - `width` (to adjust image size)

## ðŸ©º Relevance to Health

Learning how to use attributes like `href`, `alt`, and `target` is essential for building accessible and functional health web tools. For example, creating buttons that link to vaccination centers, displaying medical images with descriptions, and ensuring information opens safely in new tabs â€” all rely on these foundational HTML skills.

This is part of my SheCodes Basics journey and helped me understand how HTML attributes helps add controls asides structure to web elements.
