# CSS Spacing Challenge

CSS spacing involves using properties like margin and padding to create visual distance between elements. Proper spacing enhances readability, flow, and overall user experience.

`Margin`: this is space around an element
`Padding`: this is space within an element

### Usually written in this manner `margin` {20px,0,20px, 10px} meaning {top, right, bottom , left}

For this challenge, I focused on centering a button using margin and styling it with appropriate padding and colors to make it visually appealing and aligned with the overall page design.

As with previous challenges, I used Internal CSS, with all styles written inside the HTML <style> tag.

## Overview of the Code

In css_spacing_challenge.html, I followed the layout demonstrated in this CodePen: https://codepen.io/matthieua/full/pXOQmr?editors=1100.

I:
Created a centered “Apply now” button using display: block and margin: 20px auto.

Styled the button with padding (10px 20px) and customized font size and colors.

Preserved a consistent theme and alignment across headers, list links, and the bottom image.

Added spacing to separate the button visually from other content for clarity.

This challenge helped me understand how CSS spacing works and how to combine vertical margin and horizontal centering using auto margins.

## Relevance to Healthcare

In healthcare web interfaces, strategic spacing is essential for clear visual hierarchy—ensuring users can easily distinguish between primary actions (e.g., “Apply Now,” “Schedule Appointment”) and supplementary information. This improves accessibility and reduces cognitive load for patients and health professionals using digital tools.

This challenge is part of my SheCodes Basics journey, strengthening my ability to design clean, accessible, and actionable web interfaces.
