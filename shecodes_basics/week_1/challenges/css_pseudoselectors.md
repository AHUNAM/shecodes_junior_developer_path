# CSS Pseudo-Selectors Challenge

**Pseudo-selectors** are special keywords in CSS that target the **state** or **position** of elements. They allow you to apply styles not just based on the element type or class, but on how a user is interacting with the element or where it appears in the document. One of the most common and powerful pseudo-selectors is `:hover`, which applies styles when a user moves their mouse over an element.

This challenge focuses on using **CSS pseudo-selectors**, particularly `:hover`, to make web elements interactive and visually responsive when the user hovers over them, making them also know it is clickable. This builds upon earlier lessons in CSS styling, applying transitions and color changes for better user engagement.

## Overview of the Code

In `css_pseudoselectors_challenge.html`, I followed the layout demonstrated in this CodePen:

I:

- Used the `:hover` pseudo-selector to:
  - Invert the buttonâ€™s background and text colors on hover
  - Add a `cursor: pointer` effect for clear interactivity
- Ensured smooth transitions with `transition: all 200ms ease-in-out`.

### Key CSS Concepts Demonstrated:

- `:hover`: Triggers styles when the user hovers over an element
- `transition`: Smooths the change from normal to hover state

## ðŸ©º Relevance to Health

In digital healthcare platforms, hover effects improve usability and guide user focus â€” especially for key actions like **"Click here or there"**. These visual cues help reduce confusion, encourage interaction, and enhance accessibility.

This challenge is part of my SheCodes Basics journey and helped me understand how **micro-interactions** like hover states contribute to a clean, intuitive, and user-centered design â€” essential in any health or wellness application.
