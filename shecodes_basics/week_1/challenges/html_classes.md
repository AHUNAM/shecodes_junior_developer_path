# HTML Classes Challenge

HTML classes are used to group elements so you can style them the same way using CSS. A class is written with a class="..." attribute in HTML and targeted in CSS using a period (.).

For example, .red in CSS will apply styles to any HTML element with class="red".
Classes help organize your page and make styling reusable and consistent.

## Overview

In `html_classes.html`, I followed the coding format in this demo: [https://codepen.io/Julie-Bozon/full/wvRegVY](https://codepen.io/Julie-Bozon/full/wvRegVY). The task was to update the colors of different links using **HTML classes**. I:

- Made **Coders** blue
- Made **Courses** red
- Made **Stories** green

This was a challenge to test my understanding of how HTML classes are used for styling multiple elements differently.

## Relevance to Healthcare

In healthcare websites and dashboards, HTML classes are helpful for:

- Categorizing different sections like "Patients", "Reports", "Alerts", etc.
- Styling components consistently across multiple pages
- Highlighting critical sections (e.g., class="warning", class="safe", class="urgent")

This is part of my **SheCodes Basics** journey. It helped me understand how to:

- Use classes in HTML for grouping
- Apply specific styles using class selectors in CSS
- Structure reusable and meaningful styles using clear class names

This knowledge sets the stage for accessible, well-structured health communication interfaces.
