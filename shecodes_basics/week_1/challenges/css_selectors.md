# CSS Selector Challenge

A CSS selector is the part of the CSS code that targets specific HTML elements to style them. It allows you to design the appearance of each element in your HTML file. The styles (like color, size, spacing) are written using curly brackets {} after selecting the element.

There are two main ways to write CSS:

1. Internal CSS – The CSS is written inside the HTML document, usually within the <head> using the <style> tag.
2. External CSS – The CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to your HTML through the <head>

For this challene I utilized the "Internal CSS".

## Overview of the code

In `css-elements.html`, I updated the `html_attribute` file by following the coding format in this demo: https://codepen.io/matthieua/full/xoaJzz?editors=1100.
I:

- Changed the h1 to a color I like
- Made the h1 font-size 48px
- Underlined the h1
- Made the h1 font-weight thin

This was a challenge to test my understanding in CSS selectors.

## Relevance to Healthcare

This is relevant in healthcare for creating user-friendly web interfaces for health information, highlighting important content (like warnings or results), and improving overall accessibility in digital health platforms.

This is part of my SheCodes Basics journey and helped me understand how styling works and how CSS selectors apply to real-world interfaces.
